				<i>Dear Anna,<br/><br/>

				Thank you for your trust; I hope my prediction meets your expectations and provides answers to your question. 
                The following spread shows very well what the other party's (in this case your lawyer acquaintance) thoughts and 
                feelings about you and what is projected to be between you both in the future.<br/><br/>

				As you can see, the top three cards show that your lawyer friend is attracted to you 
                and feels good in your company; he likes spending his time with you.  The problem is that he does not know enough 
                about as you do not show your inner self. Therefore he believes you don't take him seriously, even though he wants 
                to have a serious relationship and to find his soul mate. <br/><br/>
                
                The cards located in the bottom line, which represent emotions, show that he has no self confidence, that`s why he 
                is very shy and doesn`t dare to take any steps. You are a very attractive women and he thinks that he has no chance 
                and believes there is another man around you - who appears as his rival in this spread - and he fears that this person 
                will seduce you; which is also enforced by your behavior.<br/><br/>

				The current situation is shown by the three cards on the left of the third line. Both of you are thinking about the 
                other, but because of his self confidence problems there is no developing in this case. He is very closed and doubts 
                you will have an future together.<br/><br/>

				The three cards at the right side, in the third line, tell that everything depends on you. You have to take the 
                first steps and show your emotions and that you are interested in a serious relationship with him. If you do this, 
                he will feel himself more self-confident, his doubts and inhibitions will disappear and he will be able to open up 
                emotionally with you and you can create a happy and stable relationship. <br/><br/>

				Good luck!<br/><br/>

				Love,<br/>
				Abigail</i>
