## **🚨 Important Notes**

### **If You Need to Pause:**
- Just click **"← Back to Queue"** anytime
- Your text is NOT saved (start fresh next time)
- The order stays in the queue

### **If Email Doesn't Send:**
- The order is still marked as fulfilled
- You can manually email the customer
- Check with your tech person if this happens often

### **If You Make a Mistake:**
- Currently, you can't "undo" a fulfilled order
- You can manually send a follow-up email
- Future update will add a "re-send" button

### **Languages:**
The email is automatically sent in the customer's chosen language:
- **EN** = English
- **DE** = German (Deutsch)
- **PT** = Portuguese (Português)
- **HU** = Hungarian (Magyar)

Only the email template (subject, greeting, signature) changes.  
**Your reading text is NOT translated** - you need to write in the correct language yourself!

---

## **⏰ Best Practices**

### **Timing:**
- Try to fulfill within **24 hours** of payment
- The email says "delivered within 24 hours" so this builds trust
- Customers are notified immediately after payment that you'll deliver soon

### **Quality:**
- Each reading should be **unique and personal**
- Avoid copy-pasting generic text
- The photo makes it **authentic** - highly recommended!
- Aim for 500-1000 words minimum

### **Order:**
- Fulfill oldest orders first (top of the list)
- Or prioritize by payment amount
- Or go by language (batch similar languages together)
